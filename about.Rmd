### Bio

I am a first-year Biostatistics PhD Fellow at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. My research interest lie in understanding the underlying statistical models and computational methods in genomics and genetics.I have previously worked as a Computational Research Technician at Weill Cornell Medicine where I first got the opportunity to learn and work in genomics research. There, I conducted data processing and analysis and, completed a scientific paper as a first author on the effects of interferon-alpha (IFN$\alpha$) on human blood development. I also pay a keen interest in learning more about science-based policies and decision making, and contributing to the field in the future. 

Apart from my interest in public health, I seek to stay rooted with my community back home in Nepal. In 2021, I co-founded an initiative - Aakar Nepal, where we connect with youths in high school and provide them with the resources and training to lead social initiatives in their community. It has been inspiring to see youngsters network mentors in their field of interest, form a community of like-minded people who want to pay it forward in the community.
